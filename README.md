# Samsung Galaxy S Smartphone Accelerometer data
The data is publically avaialble from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones). In brief, 30 volunteers, aged 19-48 years, performed six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying) while wearing the Samsung Galaxy S II on their waist. The phone captured triaxial acceleration with an accelerometer and triaxial angular velocity from the gyroscope. This dataset is a subset of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphone Dataset Version 1.0 and includes the mean and standard deviation of each measurement averaged across time for each activity and person.
